dijitx
======

A host of Dojo Widgets. **DIJIT X** has what **DIJIT** and dojo **X** doesn't!

Open, Free and brought to you by the good people at [RCorp](http://wwww.rcorp.co.in).


Widgets
-------

####Fieldset
This is a widget to introduce `<fieldset>` into Dojo.

####AutofillCheckBox
An extension of Dijit's ````CheckBox```` for Autofilling a group of Dijit Widgets with values from another group of Dijit Widgets. Useful in cases like **"Tick if Billing Address and Home Adress are the same"**.


The project team hopes the Dojo loving community would help out in the development of **dijitx** via [Reporting Issues](https://github.com/rcorp/dijitx/issues) and submiting patches and [other contributions](https://github.com/rcorp/dijitx/fork_select).
